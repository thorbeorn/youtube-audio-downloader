# Get all video URLs from a playlist
print(playlist.getAllVideoURLFromPlaylist(url))

# Get a specific video URL from a playlist by index
print(playlist.getVideoURLFromPlaylist(url, 3))

# Get the playlist URL from a video URL
parsed_url = video.getPlaylistURLFromVideo(url)
if not parsed_url['noError']:
    raise Exception("Unexpected exception on parsing playlist URL")
print(parsed_url['url'])

# Get the video URL inside a playlist URL
